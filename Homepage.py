st.markdown("""
This application simulates Formula 1 qualifying sessions using real session data.

- Each simulation runs Q1, Q2 and Q3, with eliminations at each stage.
- Supports every Grand Prix from 2018 to present.

st.subheader("How it works")

st.markdown("""
- Lap times are predicted using historical data and Monte Carlo simulation.
- Qualifying sets the order for the race. Three sessions take place in qualifying:
  - **Q1** – The slowest 5 (or 6 in 2026) drivers are eliminated. Their finishing position here becomes their starting position for the race. The remaining drivers progress to Q2.
  - **Q2** – Same format as Q1. The fastest 10 drivers make it into Q3, while eliminated drivers have their positions set.
  - **Q3** – The final shootout that determines the top 10 starting order. The fastest driver starts on pole.
- The simulated results calculates the most likely finishing order from the repeated simulations.

st.markdown("- Lap times are normally distributed.")
st.markdown("- Limited to 2018 onwards as previous data is unavailable.")
st.markdown("- Drivers who progressed into a session in a simulation that they did not reach in real life are given an averaged improved lap from the previous session.")
